# Personalized-Feed-for-Cooking-Articles

The aim of the project was to create a personalized cooking news feed engine which provides an email to the user's inbox whenever a new cooking article of interest is available.

Following were the steps:

1. Created a supervised text dataset using Pocket app, Embed.ly API and Beautiful soup library.

2. Incorporated NPL to preprocess the text data and SVM to train the model.

3. Integrated IFFFT with RSS Feeds to manage streaming data, Google Sheets to store
new articles and Email to set up the daily personal newslette
